		<p class="abstract">
			<!--<a href="http://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> is an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit.-->As Doc Searls recently put it, Wikipedia is, like the protocols of the Net, "a set of agreements". A Web protocol defines
			the way in which computers communicate with each other and make decisions to ensure successful transactions. Wikipedia
			policies have the same purpose, but instead of transactions between machines, they regulate human decisions. An important
			part of these decisions bear on
			<em>what topics are suitable for inclusion</em> in Wikipedia and
			<em>what topics are not</em>.
			<!--As any writer knows, this is perhaps the most delicate editorial issue ever. -->The present project looks into the nature and shape of collective decisions about the inclusion of a topic in Wikipedia.
		</p>
		<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Notable topics and AfD discussions</h3>
		<p>Like a garden, an online encyclopedia needs constant weeding. Unlike a garden, an online encyclopedia has thousands of
			potential gardeners. Over years Wikipedia has developed guidelines and policies to help editors
			<em>collectively decide</em> whether topics are suitable for inclusion or not. All articles, especially new ones, are reviewed
			by the community to determine if they meet Wikipedia's
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" target="_blank">notability guidelines</a>. Any editor can nominate an article for deletion and, if this nomination is legitimate, a community
			discussion takes place where any fellow
			<strike>gardeners</strike> editors have the opportunity to make their voices heard. The usual process is to have a week-long discussion
			during which community members can discuss in favor or against keeping the article. At the end of this period an administrator
			reviews the discussion and speaks the final verdict. </p>
		<p>
			We analyzed and visualized
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" target="_blank">Article for Deletion (AfD)</a> discussions in the English Wikipedia. The visualization above represents the 100 longest
			discussions that resulted in the deletion of the respective article. AfD discussions are represented by a thread starting
			at the bottom center. Each time a user joins an AfD discussion and recommends to
			<em>keep</em>,
			<em>merge</em>, or
			<em>redirect</em> the article a green segment leaning towards the left is added. Each time a user recommends to
			<em>delete</em> the article a red segment leaning towards the right is added. As the discussion progresses, the length of
			the segments as well as the angle slowly decay.
		</p>
		<p>What decides whether consensus is reached is the administrator closing the AfD discussion, not a headcount. As a result,
			the proportion of
			<em>Keeps</em> and
			<em>Deletes</em> may be at odds with the final decision, as illustrated by the above visualization. AfD discussions also take
			a variety of shapes depending on how they evolve over time.</p>

			<h4>Swinging</h4>
			<p class="caption">Discussions follow an s-shaped trajectory when a series of
				<em>Deletes</em> is followed by a consistent series of
				<em>Keeps</em> or vice versa. This pattern may indicate that participants with similar opinions flock together and join the
				discussion at the same time.</p>

			<em>not</em> result in the deletion of the article (i.e the article was kept, merged or redirected):

		<h3>Some interesting facts about AfD discussions</h3>
		<p>
			Articles can be nominated for deletion multiple times. The decision to keep the article resulting from an AfD can be overturned
			by a new nomination at a later time: the article "Sexuality of Robert Baden-Powell", for example, was deleted at the 4th
			nomination after 2 discussions ending with no consensus and one ending with a
			<em>Keep</em> decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			Long AfD discussions are exceptional and not all AfD discussions are as crowded as those represented above. The longest AfD
			discussions do not give a representative picture of how this process works in most cases. The
			<a href="#ref">analysis of a large sample of AfD discussions</a> (200K discussions that took place between November 2002 and July 2010)
			suggests that the largest part of these discussions ends after only a few recommendations are expressed.

			Splitting up the chart by the outcome of the discussion, and the vote distribution, reveals some interesting facts:
			<ul>
				<li>Not all AfD discussions start with a
					<em>Delete</em> recommendation: sometimes the initial nominator suggests to merge or redirect the entry.</li>
				<li>A typical discussion consists of only three or four recommendations. In most cases these discussions are so short simply
					because the topic under discussion is trivially non-notable.</li>
				<li>Quite a few discussions are closed with a
					<em>Keep</em> decision right after the initial nomination (thereby overriding the nomination). Deletion decisions occurring
					after only one recommendation is expressed, in comparison, are much less frequent.</li>
				<li>Delete decisions tend to be fairly unanimous. In contrast, we found many
					<em>Keep</em> decisions resulting from a discussion that leaned towards deletion: this can happen if no clear consensus
					emerged from the discussion, or if participants advocating deletion did not appeal to the right policy. In general,
					this means that administrators tend to apply the deletion guidelines in a conservative way.</li>

				<a href="#ref">Further analysis</a> shows that consensus is often hard to reach. The figure below (left) shows the distribution of
				<em>duration</em> (in seconds) of AfD discussions. While the vast majority lasts
				<em>less than one week</em>, there is a sizable minority that takes up to two weeks or more. Some discussions took more than
				one year to be closed!</li>
			<li>How passionate are these discussions? The figure below (right) shows the distribution of
				<em>activity rates</em> (in "votes" per second), i.e. how fast new participants join a discussion. In general,
				<em>one new participant per day</em> is the norm but in many cases the activity rate can increase to one new participant
				every half an hour.</li>
